# Empirical Study on the Impact of Label-Text Mismatch on GitHub Issue Resolution Time

 This empirical study provides compelling evidence that label-text mismatch
 significantly impacts issue resolution time in GitHub repositories. Our findings
 highlight the critical role of accurate and consistent labeling practices in fostering
 efficient software development workflows. By leveraging NLP techniques to identify
 and quantify label mismatches, we have demonstrated a statistically significant
 correlation between these discrepancies and prolonged resolution times. The p-value
 of 0.0132 underscores the robustness of this finding.
 
 To mitigate the negative effects of label-text mismatch, we recommend the following:
 
**Automated Labeling Tools:** Implement or integrate automated labeling tools
 that utilize machine learning models to suggest or enforce accurate labels based
 on issue content. This can reduce human error and ensure consistency.
 
 **Clear Labeling Guidelines:** Establish and disseminate clear, concise guidelines
 for issue labeling within development teams. Regular training and adherence to
 these guidelines can improve label accuracy.
 
 **Regular Label Audits:** Periodically review and audit existing labels to identify
 and correct mismatches. This proactive approach can prevent the accumulation
 of inaccurate labels over time.
 
 ### Future work could expand upon this research by:
 **Investigating Root Causes:** Delve deeper into the root causes of label-text
 mismatch, such as developer experience, project size, or specific types of issues.
 
**Proposing Remediation Strategies:** Develop and evaluate automated or semi
automated systems for correcting label mismatches and assess their impact on
 resolution time.
 
 **Cross-Platform Analysis:** Extend the study to other issue tracking systems
 beyond GitHub to determine if these findings are generalizable across different
 platforms.
 
 **Qualitative Analysis:** Conduct qualitative interviews with developers and project
 managers to gain a deeper understanding of their labeling practices and the
 challenges they face.
 
 By addressing the issue of label-text mismatch, software development teams can
 enhance their efficiency, improve communication, and ultimately deliver higher
 quality software more rapidly
